        In 2023, Generative AI revolutionized the educational landscape globally. Recognizing its immense potential to enhance student learning, we launched EduBridge AI in Pakistan. This initiative, in collaboration with leading experts in the field of artificial intelligence, aims to provide cutting-edge bilingual support to struggling students in public sector schools. Initially piloted in three high schools in Balochistan, EduBridge AI has since expanded its reach to over 80 schools nationwide, positively impacting the education of more than 50,000 students.</p>

The development of EduBridge AI was rooted in a multidisciplinary collaborative approach. We partnered with a diverse team of leading voices in artificial intelligence including former Google, Meta, and Microsoft employees and members of academia specializing in artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and computational learning. This collaboration was mission-critical in designing a user-friendly, culturally sensitive, and linguistically inclusive platform that catered to the diverse needs of Pakistani students.
<br></br><br></br>
One of the primary goals was to create an easy-to-use user interface that could accommodate students with varying levels of technological familiarity. The system was developed as a conversational AI tool accessible via tablets. EduBridge AI employed state-of-the-art generative AI algorithms capable of providing real-time data and responses to student queries in both Urdu and English. The bilingual capability ensured that language barriers, a significant impediment in Pakistan&apos;s education system, were effectively addressed.
<br></br><br></br>
The proprietary system was designed to be adaptive. It allowed students to ask questions, seek clarifications, and engage in discussions on any subject they were learning. Advanced machine learning models enabled the system to provide accurate and subject-specific answers while also identifying areas of difficulty for students. This feature allowed for personalized learning for each student, ensuring that each student received the support they needed.To ensure broad accessibility, IHP provided cheaply-sourced free tablets for students in underprivileged communities. This effort was bolstered by collaborations with international organizations such as the United Nations Development Programme &#40;UNDP&#41; and local provincial governments. These partnerships allowed EduBridge AI to reach underperforming academic institutions across Pakistan, focusing on regions with the most significant educational disparities.
<br></br><br></br>
The tablets came preloaded with the EduBridge AI application, requiring minimal internet connectivity, a critical consideration given Pakistan&apos;s inconsistent digital infrastructure. Additionally, educators and administrators were trained to integrate EduBridge AI into their classrooms effectively.
<br></br><br></br>
We saw many statistical improvements in metrics that were monitored. Our longitudinal annual study demonstrated a 35% improvement in test scores across mathematics, science, and language arts. Educators reported over a 20% increase in classroom engagement, which led to a substantial improvement in retention rate for challenging subjects. In regions where cultural norms often limit girls&apos; access to education, EduBridge AI proved to be a game-changer. Female students in participating schools showed a 30% improvement in academic performance, and their classroom participation increased by 20%. Rural schools, often lacking resources and qualified educators, saw significant improvements. Students in rural areas experienced a 40% increase in subject proficiency compared to urban counterparts who did not use EduBridge AI.
<br></br><br></br>
EduBridge AI aims to expand its reach to an additional 200 schools in the next two years. Plans are underway to incorporate advanced features such as predictive analytics to anticipate students&apos; learning trajectories and develop a professional development module for teachers, equipping them with the skills to harness AI&apos;s full potential in their classrooms.
