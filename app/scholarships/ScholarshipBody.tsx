        Pakistan ranks among the top emitters of carbon emissions globally. Reducing carbon emissions is a critical priority for us. GreenMoto electric motorbikes, manufactured at a partner facility, are subsidized to make them accessible to the general public. Over 26,000 GreenMoto electric motorbikes have been distributed to low-income individuals, significantly contributing to the reduction of carbon emissions and promoting sustainable transportation in Pakistan. Our unique charge-at-home protocol allows for greater affordability and accessibility.</p>

The rise of electric vehicles &#40;EVs&#41; internationally has sparked a worldwide movement toward sustainable transportation. Inspired by this trend, we aimed to adapt EV technology to meet Pakistan&apos;s unique socioeconomic needs. Unlike many nations where cars dominate EV markets, Pakistan&apos;s dense cities, socio-economic challenges, and reliance on two-wheeled transport prompted us to focus on electric motorbikes instead of cars. This approach addresses key concerns such as affordability, congestion, and upkeep costs while ensuring practical usage for a wide variety of users.
<br></br><br></br>
Motorbikes are known as the backbone of transportation in Pakistan. More affordable than cars, simpler to maintain, and ideal for navigation of congested urban centers, these vehicles offer immense benefits to the average person. Recognizing these benefits, we devised a plan to manufacture GreenMoto electric motorbikes locally. Local production would not only reduce costs but also generate employment. The distribution model was designed with accessibility in mind, targeting low-income individuals who rely heavily on motorbikes for their livelihoods.
<br></br><br></br>
Our journey began with a simple question, how do we make EV technology accessible to Pakistan&apos;s vulnerable centers? The answer lies in evaluating the needs of our target audience - individuals who rely on motorbikes for daily income, such as delivery industry workers, ride-share operators, and laborers, as well as those involved in agriculture and logistics. These people form the backbone of Pakistan&apos;s economic growth and often struggle with the costs associated with volatile fossil fuel prices.
<br></br><br></br>
GreenMoto electric motorbikes were designed to offer a reliable, cost-effective alternative. Unlike traditional motorbikes that rely on expensive and environmentally damaging fossil fuels, GreenMotos operate on rechargeable batteries. Our unique charge-at-home protocol ensures that users can recharge their vehicles conveniently, eliminating the need for expensive charging stations. This innovation drastically reduces both operational costs and barriers to entry for electric transportation.
<br></br><br></br>
GreenMoto&apos;s impact is not just visible in financial terms but also in its crucial contributions to environmental sustainability. Over 26,000 GreenMotos have been distributed, enabling a significant transition from conventional fuel-powered vehicles to clean energy alternatives. The affordability of these motorbikes along with subsidisation by IHP ensures that even the economically disadvantaged may benefit from this green tech.
<br></br><br></br>
Reducing carbon emissions is a critical global priority, and GreenMoto is playing a pivotal role in Pakistan&apos;s efforts. Each electric motorbike reduces emissions by approximately 0.5 metric tons annually. Cumulatively, the adoption of GreenMoto has prevented over 13,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere.
<br></br><br></br>
We aim to render this initiative successful upon the distribution of over 500,000 GreenMotos and the setting up of 4 local manufacturing plants.
